I'm known to be very picky about my material belongings, and also for being very minimal. I just finished a 10 week trip across USA, Mexico, and Peru carrying just one bag that fits under the seat of a flight. Also, a friend of mine wanted to gift me something, and she was so challenged with my attitude to gifts and ended up asking me what I wanted. I had no answer. I still don't, but below are some ideas (mostly on what not to gift):

## 1. Don't Gift Anything

The simplest and most effective. By not gifting anything, one or more of the following are saved:

- Space in my house
- Space in the truck each time I move
- Time spent in packing the item everytime I move
- Time and money spent on maintaining the item
- Time spent on engaging with the item
- Your headspace on deciding what to gift to me
- My headspace on deciding what to do with your gift
- The feeling of guilt if I decide to sell or dispose your gift

## 2. Don't Gift Expensive Stuff

Gifting me an iPhone? I'm gonna sell it within an hour for cash. By gifting me expensive things you are actually burdening me with the need to care for it. I live without a locker in the house, and don't worry about leaving the house unlocked. I've left my backpack cloaked in random backpacker hostels and small mom-and-pop shops on my adventures. Expensive things take away all these freedoms from me.

## 3. Don't Gift Fragile Items

I have better things to do in life than trying not to knock them over or accidentally drop them.

## 4. Clothes And Wearables: Absolute No-No

The textile industry (like almost every other industry) is unsustainable and polluting. I try to do my part by buying as less as possible. I do my research on what to buy, where to buy and how long it lasts.

Moreover, I don't like to fold or iron my clothes - I buy only clothes that don't need this. I do my laundry with a washer-dryer - not all clothes do well with this setup. My whole idea of clothing is optimized for saving time. Don't even try to change my 'dressing sense' by gifting something. Your gift will be promptly donated away.

I also do not like to wear anything on my body other than clothes. I occasionally make an exception for watches. No rings, no chains, no nonsense. I like to feel light. Any precious metal gifted will be sold for cash.

## 5. No Celebratory Gifting

For me, becoming lighter is becoming free to new experiences, and that is worth celebrating. The idea of celebrating by stuffing more objects into my life is absurd.

## 6. Gift Your Time

It means a lot when you show up where I am and we spend some quality time. I see time as the fundamental currency of life, and your time is the most precious thing you can give me. A dinner, a boat ride, a hike together, or just walking around to get coffee while catching up or having deep conversations. These are the things I've cherished the most.

## 7. I Won't Say No To Money

If you don't have time, I can take money. I won't say no. Money is useful. Just know that I won't feel obliged to return the gift.

## 8. Some Gifts I've Liked

Doesn't mean I'll like them again.

- Exploding Kittens
- A piece of art that you made
- A USB Drive When I Was In High School (not a good idea now)
- Roasted Coffee Beans
- Hand Coffee Grinder
- A TV Video Game Unit (I got as a kid)

## P.S.: Don't Wrap It

Gift wraps are disgusting. They take up time to open. Running to find a scissor to cut the wrapper is annoying. People got offended if I rip them apart. The wrappers end up in landfills and will likely stay there for thousands of years. Give it to me straight and raw.
