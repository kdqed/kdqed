Hello Friend! Welcome to my website.

I'm often asked, "What do you do?". This website is a futile attempt at answering that question. Below is a non-exhaustive and mutually non-exclusive list of buckets capturing my work (and play):

- [Full Stack Engineering](https://github.com/kdqed)
- [Travel Writing](https://mapscrollerdiaries.substack.com)
- [Technical Writing](/technical-writing)
- [Data Journalism](/data-journalism)

## Ok, But What's Your Designation?
If you still feel the need to assign me a designation, here is a quote from a book by the science fiction author Robert Heinlein:
> A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly.
